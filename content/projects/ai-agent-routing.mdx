## AI-Powered Multi-Agent Routing System for Northwestern Memorial Hospital

As part of an advanced GenAI systems course, I developed a multi-agent AI system that mimics how hospital triage teams or call centers interpret and respond to unstructured patient inquiries. The goal was to create a real-time message routing system powered by LLMs, simulating department-level coordination in a hospital setting.

### Objective

- Build dedicated AI agents representing different hospital departments.
- Use a central Operator Agent to classify the intent of incoming messages.
- Route the message to relevant departments using a LangGraph-based agent graph.
- Ensure the system could handle ambiguous or multi-intent messages reliably.

### Implementation Overview

#### Operator Agent (LLM-based)

The Operator receives raw patient queries like:  
`"I need to schedule an MRI and also ask about billing."`

It then classifies the message into one or more relevant hospital departments using a custom GPT-4 prompt. The output is a clean, comma-separated list of departments such as:
Radiology, Billing/insurance.

#### Department Agents

Each department agent is an LLM chain that responds only when triggered. Agents were built for:

- Emergency Room  
- Primary Care  
- Radiology  
- Pediatrics  
- Cardiology  
- Billing/Insurance  

Each agent is prompted with a domain-specific template and returns a concise, relevant response.

#### LangGraph Orchestration

LangGraph’s `StateGraph` was used to manage agent flow:

- Shared state includes message, predicted intents, and individual agent responses.
- Conditional branching allows routing to one or more departments in parallel.
- All paths terminate cleanly at an END node after collecting responses.

#### Prompt Design & Safety

- Custom `PromptTemplates` were created for each agent.
- Prompts were structured to ensure relevance, prevent hallucinations, and maintain medical tone.
- Outputs were parsed in structured formats to maintain control and consistency.

### Testing & Performance

- System was tested with 50+ realistic hospital queries.
- Achieved **100% routing accuracy**: each query was classified to the correct departments.
- GPT-4 returned department responses in under 1.5 seconds on average.

### Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11**
- **LangGraph** – for agent routing
- **LangChain** – for LLM chaining
- **OpenAI GPT-4** – for intent classification and agent responses
- **Pydantic / TypedDict** – for shared state
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for prototyping and showcasing
- **PromptTemplate** – for custom prompt logic

### GenAI Concepts Demonstrated

- Multi-agent orchestration using LLMs and state machines  
- Real-world simulation of LLM routing in enterprise healthcare  
- RAG-style reasoning with intent-classify-and-respond loops  
- Parallel processing of multi-intent queries  
- Structured output, controlled latency, and agent isolation
