## Toxic Comment Classifier

Between August 2022 and April 2023, I developed a machine learning system that identifies toxic or harmful content in user-generated comments. The project aimed to support content moderation teams by flagging offensive or aggressive language with high precision.

### Objective

- Detect toxic comments in online forums, social platforms, and feedback forms.
- Build a deep learning model that generalizes well across multiple platforms and comment styles.
- Ensure high data quality and reproducibility through structured preprocessing.

### Workflow

#### Dataset and Preprocessing

- Collected and consolidated **20,000+ comments** from public online datasets and forums.
- Applied data cleaning techniques including stop word removal, lowercasing, lemmatization, and punctuation stripping.
- Tokenized and padded all text sequences to a fixed length for model compatibility.

#### Model Architecture

- Used a **Bidirectional LSTM** model built with TensorFlow and Keras.
- Embedded text using `Embedding` layers followed by two stacked bidirectional LSTM layers for contextual learning.
- Added Dense layers with dropout for regularization and sigmoid activation for binary classification.

#### Performance

- Achieved **97% accuracy** on the validation set for classifying toxic vs. non-toxic comments.
- Maintained strong performance on edge cases such as sarcastic toxicity and veiled insults.
- Training pipeline included stratified sampling, early stopping, and learning rate tuning.

### Tools & Stack

- **TensorFlow / Keras** – for model building, training, and evaluation  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – for data cleaning and feature engineering  
- **NLTK / SpaCy** – for natural language preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for EDA and result visualization  

### Skills Demonstrated

- Deep learning architecture design for NLP problems  
- Bidirectional LSTM implementation and tuning  
- Text preprocessing pipeline development  
- Model validation, evaluation, and optimization  
- Building ethical AI systems for real-world moderation use cases

This project helped reinforce my understanding of NLP and sequence modeling. It also highlighted the importance of responsible AI when working with content that affects people’s digital experience.
