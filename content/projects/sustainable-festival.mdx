## Sustainable Festival Travel Analysis

As part of the STEP UP National Highways Career Challenge, I collaborated on a data-driven project focused on reducing the environmental impact of festival-related travel. The aim was to uncover insights that could inform sustainable transportation planning, minimize congestion, and promote eco-friendly travel behaviors.

### Objectives

- Identify major contributors to travel-based CO₂ emissions.
- Explore how travel preferences vary by age, region, and timing.
- Propose actionable changes such as carpooling strategies to reduce total output.
- Build predictive models and interactive dashboards to support planning decisions.

### What We Did

We worked with a real-world dataset of over 20,000 travel records.

#### Power BI Visualizations

- Designed a DAX-powered KPI dashboard to highlight key patterns:
  - Petrol vehicles contributed 81% of total CO₂ emissions.
  - Travel peaks and congestion timings across different festivals.
  - Age-wise transport mode preferences for targeted sustainability outreach.
- Included drilldowns to explore emission contributions by vehicle type, region, and user segment.

#### Predictive Modeling in R

- Built an XGBoost model (R² = 0.998) to forecast CO₂ emissions based on travel mode and distance.
- Used the model to simulate carbon reduction scenarios under different carpooling strategies.
- Estimated that carpooling could reduce emissions by up to **12.8 million kilograms**.

### Key Outcomes

- Presented insights via an interactive dashboard to support policy and outreach.
- Proposed optimized travel timings and group travel campaigns to reduce congestion and footprint.
- Earned a **virtual certificate of completion** for successfully delivering actionable recommendations.

### Tools & Stack

- **Power BI** – dashboarding, DAX, KPI cards, data visuals  
- **R** – data preprocessing, modeling, XGBoost  
- **XGBoost** – regression-based emission predictions  
- **DAX** – for KPIs and interactive filters  
- **Excel/CSV** – initial dataset handling  

### Skills Demonstrated

- Data visualization and storytelling with impact  
- Predictive modeling using real transportation datasets  
- KPI definition and dashboard interactivity in Power BI  
- Communicating results to both technical and non-technical stakeholders  
- Collaboration in a remote, time-constrained setting

This project provided a practical opportunity to combine data analytics with environmental awareness. It also reinforced the importance of visualization and modeling in making sustainability data accessible and actionable.
