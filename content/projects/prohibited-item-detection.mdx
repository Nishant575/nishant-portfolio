## Prohibited Item Detection in Airport Baggage

From May to June 2024, I worked on a computer vision project aimed at strengthening airport security systems by detecting prohibited items in passenger baggage. The project involved building a deep learning pipeline that could process X-ray scans and automatically flag threats with bounding boxes.

### Objective

- Develop an object detection model to identify restricted items in X-ray baggage images.
- Reduce false positives while maintaining high recall to support real-world deployment.
- Provide interpretable predictions to assist security personnel in screening.

### Workflow

#### Dataset

- Used a dataset of over 7000 labeled X-ray images representing real-world airport baggage scans.
- Bounding box annotations were provided for classes such as knife, gun, scissors, lighter, and tools.

#### Data Preprocessing

- Conducted exploratory analysis to understand class imbalance, image resolution variations, and annotation quality.
- Applied augmentation techniques including scaling, flipping, and contrast adjustment to increase training diversity.
- Converted all annotations into YOLO-compatible `.txt` format using `LabelImg`.

#### Model Training with YOLOv8

- Implemented YOLOv8 using the Ultralytics framework in Python.
- Trained the model over multiple epochs with custom batch size and learning rate schedules.
- Monitored metrics like mAP (mean Average Precision), confidence scores, and IOU overlap for validation.

#### Results

- Achieved a **30% improvement in threat identification accuracy** compared to baseline models.
- Reduced false positives by **25%**, helping minimize unnecessary manual bag checks.
- Model demonstrated strong localization precision and real-time inference capabilities.

### Tools & Stack

- **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** – core detection model  
- **Python** – preprocessing, model training, evaluation  
- **OpenCV / Matplotlib** – image visualization and augmentation  
- **LabelImg** – annotation conversion and inspection  
- **Pandas / NumPy** – dataset statistics and analysis  

### Skills Demonstrated

- Deep learning model development with real-world image data  
- Bounding box annotation handling and augmentation  
- Hyperparameter tuning and evaluation for object detection  
- Communicating model performance and safety improvements  
- Understanding trade-offs in precision vs recall in a high-risk domain

This project sharpened my skills in computer vision and model optimization, while also highlighting how AI can support critical safety systems when designed carefully and tested thoroughly.
