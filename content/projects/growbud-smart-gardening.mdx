## GrowBud – AI-Powered Smart Gardening App  
**ScarletHacks Hackathon, 2025**

GrowBud was developed during ScarletHacks as a mobile MVP in under 24 hours. It’s designed to help users grow plants in low-light apartment settings by combining photo analysis, weather data, and AI-powered guidance. The goal was to simplify smart gardening and make plant care more accessible, even for urban dwellers with limited sunlight exposure.

### Objective

- Recommend plants suited for a user's indoor space based on real-time lighting and climate conditions.
- Offer dynamic care instructions with reminders and status tracking to improve plant survival.
- Build a mobile-first MVP using modern full-stack technologies and OpenAI’s vision model.

### How the App Works

1. **Photo Upload**  
   Users take a photo of the spot where they want to grow a plant.

2. **Environment Analysis**  
   The app analyzes the image using GPT-4o-mini vision capabilities and retrieves local weather data via API.

3. **AI Recommendations**  
   Based on lighting, space, and climate, the app suggests suitable plants optimized for those conditions.

4. **Plant Selection + Care**  
   Once a plant is selected, GrowBud provides:
   - Watering schedules
   - Light exposure reminders
   - Progress tracking
   - Status check notifications

### Tech Stack

- **React Native** – cross-platform mobile development  
- **Node.js + Express** – backend APIs and weather data integration  
- **TypeScript** – type-safe logic across client and server  
- **PostgreSQL** – stores user preferences, plant data, reminders  
- **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini** – analyzes user-uploaded images and interprets space suitability  
- **OpenWeatherMap API** – real-time weather and climate context  

### Key Features

- Real-time photo analysis using AI vision  
- Personalized plant suggestions based on microclimate  
- Daily care guidance via scheduled push notifications  
- Lightweight MVP structure ready for scaling post-hackathon  

### Results & Impact

- Delivered a working MVP within 24 hours  
- Beta users reported improved plant survival in indoor environments  
- Demonstrated clear engagement through care tracking and daily interaction  
- Recognized by hackathon judges for its practical AI use and usability

### Skills Demonstrated

- End-to-end mobile app development under tight deadlines  
- REST API integration and real-time data handling  
- Vision model prompting for environmental interpretation  
- Designing intuitive mobile UI/UX for guided actions  
- Collaborating in high-pressure team settings with full-stack coordination

GrowBud was more than just a hackathon project—it tackled a real-world problem with a focused, data-driven approach that combined AI reasoning with accessible design.
