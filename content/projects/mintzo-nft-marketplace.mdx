## Mintzo – NFT Marketplace

From August 2022 to April 2023, I co-developed **Mintzo**, a decentralized NFT trading platform that allows users to create, store, display, and exchange digital assets on the blockchain. The project focused on building a secure, scalable, and intuitive marketplace for NFTs, backed by blockchain infrastructure and smart contract logic.

### Objectives

- Build a fully functional NFT marketplace for 500+ digital assets.
- Enable wallet integration, NFT minting, and secure crypto-based transactions.
- Leverage blockchain infrastructure to maintain asset ownership and transaction transparency.

### Platform Features

- **NFT Dashboard**: Users can browse, filter, and preview available NFTs with metadata and ownership details.
- **Secure Wallet Transactions**: Integrated crypto wallet support for minting, purchasing, and transferring assets.
- **Custom Asset Display**: NFTs can be styled and previewed dynamically before listing or transfer.
- **Minting Flow**: Simplified flow using `ThirdWeb` smart contract SDKs to allow users to mint NFTs with metadata, royalties, and supply controls.

### Tech Stack & Infrastructure

- **ReactJS** – built the frontend marketplace UI, routing, and dynamic asset rendering  
- **ThirdWeb** – used for smart contract deployment, NFT minting, and blockchain interaction  
- **Ganache** – simulated blockchain network for local development and testing  
- **AWS Lambda** – handled serverless backend functions such as user verification and asset management  
- **Amazon Managed Blockchain** – used for hosting decentralized transaction records securely  
- **GitHub** – managed collaborative development and code versioning  

### Outcomes

- Mintzo successfully handled over **500+ digital assets** on testnet.
- Enabled real-time, secure transactions with confirmed ownership transfers on-chain.
- Demonstrated the use of decentralized architecture in building trust-driven digital economies.

### Skills Demonstrated

- End-to-end dApp development using modern frontend frameworks  
- Blockchain integration and smart contract handling using ThirdWeb  
- Decentralized storage and transaction validation using AWS Blockchain services  
- UI/UX design for asset management and transaction feedback  
- Secure crypto transaction flow implementation

Mintzo was a hands-on dive into the intersection of web development and decentralized systems. It provided an opportunity to build a functional marketplace from scratch while managing smart contract logic and blockchain operations behind the scenes.
